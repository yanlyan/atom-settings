# Installation

* Be sure to use Atom 0.199 or newer.
* Install [autocomplete-python](https://github.com/sadovnychyi/autocomplete-python).
* If using a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with third-party packages, be sure to launch Atom from the [activated virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html#activate-script) to get completion for your third-party packages!
* If you're on Windows:
  * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * Make Sure that python is available in your PATH: `echo %PATH%`. If it's not, add it and restart your system: `set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python27`.

# Common problems

* "Error: spawn UNKNOWN" on Windows.
  * Solution: Find your python executable and uncheck the "Run this program as an administrator". See issue [#22](https://github.com/sadovnychyi/autocomplete-python/issues/22).
