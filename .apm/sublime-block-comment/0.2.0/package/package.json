Feel free to send a PR to add support for more languages. :smiley:\n\n# Keymap\n\n- `Ctrl-?` (`Ctrl-Shift-;` for ABNT2 keyboards on Windows/Linux): Toggle block comments.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/UltCombo/atom-sublime-block-comment/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/UltCombo/atom-sublime-block-comment#readme","_id":"sublime-block-comment@0.2.0","_shasum":"f2b83867b55231f374a013bf14dbdd3dbb47e1ab","_resolved":"file:..\\d-115828-208-1awlap7\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-115828-208-1awlap7\\package.tgz"}
